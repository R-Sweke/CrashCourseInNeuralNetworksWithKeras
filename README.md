# A Crash Course in Neural Networks with Keras

This repo contains five jupyter notebooks, providing high level introductions and working code examples in Keras for:

Supervised Learning with:

  - Feed forward neural networks
  - Convolutional neural networks
  - Recurrent neural networks

Unsupervised learning with:

  - Generative adverserial networks

Reinforcement learning with:

 - Deep-Q networks


NB! All of the code examples, images and explanations are taken from either:

     - journal articles
     - blogs
     - Keras tutorials
     - other repositories

and when relevant the sources are referenced within the notebooks.

Enjoy :)
