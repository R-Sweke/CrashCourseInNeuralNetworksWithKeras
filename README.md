# A Crash Course in Neural Networks with Keras

This repo contains five Jupyter notebooks, providing high level introductions and working code examples in Keras (with tensorflow backend) for:

Supervised Learning with:

  - Feed forward neural networks
  - Convolutional neural networks
  - Recurrent neural networks

Unsupervised learning with:

  - Generative adverserial networks

Reinforcement learning with:

 - Deep-Q networks


NB! A high percentage of the images, explanations and codes are taken from existing:

   - journal articles
   - blogs
   - Keras tutorials
   - other repositories

and when relevant the sources are referenced within the notebooks.

Enjoy :)
